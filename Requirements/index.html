				<em>Description:</em> SLUbay is a way for Faculty, Staff, and Students to connect with one another to exchange good and services. Think of it as a hyperlocal version of Craigslist, for use on the St. Lawrence campus only. This gives students a way to exchange goods and services with each other, and cuts down on the volume of email hitting the facstaff listserv. This also enables these traditionally separate groups to exchange goods with one another. This is the vision that guides the development of SLUbay.
